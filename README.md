# Project Description
ProcrastinAI is an anti-productivity app that proudly wastes your time. From generating excuses to encouraging naps and offering sarcastic anti-motivation, it’s the ultimate tool for doing absolutely nothing — beautifully.

# The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are getting too productive. No one's celebrating the joy of being lazy anymore. Everyone’s grinding, and naps are extinct.

# The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an app that fuels procrastination with features like:

>“Snooze All” button

>Absurd AI-generated excuses

>Reverse productivity tracking

>A nap timer

>And anti-motivational quotes

>It rewards laziness. Literally.

A beautifully unproductive flow: Input → Randomization → Excuse → Nap

A laptop, a cup of coffee, and a dangerously comfortable chair
