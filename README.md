🧠 Project Description
ProcrastinAI is an anti-productivity app that proudly wastes your time. From generating excuses to encouraging naps and offering sarcastic anti-motivation, it’s the ultimate tool for doing absolutely nothing — beautifully.

🚫 The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are getting too productive. No one's celebrating the joy of being lazy anymore. Everyone’s grinding, and naps are extinct.

✅ The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an app that fuels procrastination with features like:

“Snooze All” button

Absurd AI-generated excuses

Reverse productivity tracking

A nap timer

And anti-motivational quotes

It rewards laziness. Literally.

💻 Technical Details
